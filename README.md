# COVID-19 Live Dashboard (Berlin)

![COVID-19 Dashboard Screenshot](https://github.com/LearnCode801/Covid-19-Dasboard-for-Berlin-City-main/blob/main/logo%201.jpeg)

In this project, I built a robust, interactive COVID-19 dashboard that extracts **live data** from the internet. I initially developed it for Berlin, but the dashboard is completely flexible â€” it can be used for any city, region, or country.

I implemented interactive controls that allow users to select cities, regions, date ranges (for example, a 145-day window), and other filters. The dashboard updates in real time as new data becomes available, so users always see the latest situation. I also added a feature to compare multiple regions side-by-side â€” city vs. city or country vs. country â€” making it easy to analyze trends across different areas.

To make the dashboard visually engaging, I added customizable plotting options. Users can change plotting styles, background themes, and color schemes with a single click, giving them a completely different view of the data instantly. The dashboard supports overall trend visualization, univariate plots, and aggregated summaries â€” all displayed in a clean, professional interface.

I built everything from scratch, starting with live data extraction and preprocessing, then moving on to interactive plotting and dashboard design. The result is a polished, professional project that Iâ€™ve added to my GitHub portfolio to showcase my skills in data engineering, visualization, and building real-time dashboards.
